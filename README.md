## :zap: Project Title: Blockchain Enabled Decentralized E-voting System

### Problem Statement: 
Low participation of urban and youth voters in elections in India hinders their involvement in the democratic process, compromising inclusivity and raising concerns about the security and trustworthiness of the electoral system. This lack of participation stems from factors such as limited awareness about the importance of voting, disengagement from political processes, logistical challenges in accessing polling stations, and a feeling of disconnect from traditional politics among the youth. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensure a robust and representative democracy that embraces the perspectives and aspirations of urban and youth populations.
