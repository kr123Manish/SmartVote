## :zap: Project Name: SmartVote

### Problem Statement: 
How can we increase the participation of urban and youth voters in elections to ensure their involvement in the democratic process?

### Solution:
Develop a secure and decentralized remote voting APP that meets the requirements of transparency, user-friendliness, trustworthiness, and cost and time efficiency. The API will provide a reliable and accessible platform for conducting elections remotely, enabling individuals to exercise their democratic rights easily and efficiently.

### Project Flow:
- The genesis block is created on Ganache, and the smart contract for the Ballot is deployed.
